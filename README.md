-Overview-

Hello, this is Vanessa from Hong Kong. I am so happy to be here to introduce you to my hometown. Hong Kong is such a beautiful city with the ranking #1 in over 8,000 travellers in 2023 (Nath, K. 2023). Last year, there are 34 million international visitor arrivals in Hong Kong (Agne Blazyte 2024). So I would like to share some ideas on how to promote travel to Hong Kong.

-Innovative designs-

My website contains some information, pictures, a video and useful links. The pictures are alternated to create a dynamic flow and maintain visual interest, and also show the features of Hong Kong, the video can let the users have a quick look at the trip to Hong Kong in an interesting way with not just words. Users can check flight tickets, weather and exchange rate by clicking on my links. And there is an emoji in each subtitle to make the website look cuter. 

-Accessible designs (website)-

-	Used black words and white background to have a high contrast 
-	United the fonts size of headings and paragraphs
-	Embedded a Youtube video and can be played without leaving the website
-	Embedded some links for additional information

-Accessible designs (HTML/CSS)-

-	Language attribution:
Added " html lang=”en” " to indicate the language of the content, so that screen readers and the search engines can understand which language is being used.
-	Meta tags:
Added" meta charset=”UTF-8” " to indicate the character encoding of the web page.
-	Semantic HTML:
Used" main, section, footer", etc. to make the structure easier to search and understand, thus improving accessibility.
-	The alt description of images:
Added the alt descriptions for the accessibility and for some users who can’t see the images.
-	Video-container:
To ensure that the embedded video maintains its aspect ratio and adjusts to fit the width of the screen.
-	Link description:
To improve the accessibility of text links, users can understand what information the link provides before they click on it.
